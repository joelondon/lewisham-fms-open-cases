Today - Monday 17th May some of the Bins have been left out [again] on the pavement since last Wednesday`s Bin emptying day.

They regularly leave either all 4 Bins or 2 of them out obstructing the pavement for many days - often more than a week.

I originally posted a report about that because it was obstructing the pavement when I was going past with my child`s buggy especially when other people were trying to walk past the bins - I sometimes have had to go out into the road to wait for people to pass the bins before proceeding - not desirable with a child in a buggy.

At no point since I reported this problem 12 days ago have all of the bins been put back onto the residents property / removed from the pavement.

Now one of the residents has put a large orange coloured Gas bottle outside on the pavement.

I wonder if there is still Gas in the bottle ?

I feel that this could be very dangerous if for example an inquisitive child tried to turn it on not realising that they should not touch it.

Today - Monday 17th May some of the Bins have been left out [again] on the pavement since last Wednesday`s Bin emptying day.

They regularly leave either all 4 Bins or 2 of them out obstructing the pavement for many days - often more than a week.

I originally posted a report about that because it was obstructing the pavement when I was going past with my child`s buggy especially when other people were trying to walk past the bins - I sometimes have had to go out into the road to wait for people to pass the bins before proceeding - not desirable with a child in a buggy.

At no point since I reported this problem 12 days ago have all of the bins been put back onto the residents property / removed from the pavement.

Now one of the residents has put a large orange coloured Gas bottle outside on the pavement.

I wonder if there is still Gas in the bottle ?

I feel that this could be very dangerous if for example an inquisitive child tried to turn it on not realising that they should not touch it.

It is NOT good enough for the Council to just categorise this report / complaint as something like: `Passed to the Highways Department` - I cannot remember the exact term used for my previous report.",open,Large orange gas bottle fly tipped onto pavement by resident of either 38 or 38a holdenby road,2021-05-17T19:27:30+01:00,51.455481,2021-05-17T19:27:30+01:00,Fly-Tipping,-0.038557,['Lewisham Borough Council'],,,3.0
