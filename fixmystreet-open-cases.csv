For over one year Pinnacle ignored these requests and Lewisham Council stated there was adequate bin capacity regardless of the photos. The Council then said the issue was due to contamination even though no red tags had been placed on the bins for a year. In the last month red contamination tags have been placed on the bins, after the bins were already full, and these tags have remained full for days after, so like the previous 15 months residents have been forced to place recyclables in the normal waste bins because of a lack of recycling bin capacity.

Lewisham Council's default for these issues is to blame residents and state contamination. This is misleading and does not solve problems. Recycling bins are full long before collection dates, and even if there is contamination (which was not the case for over a year because no red tags) the contamination is limited and does not explain why the bins are full.

Overflowing recycling bins are then left for days, sometimes a week so residents have no choice but to throw away recyclables in normal waste bins.

Shown in the picture is the shiny new 10T weight restriction sign installed at Bromley taxpayers' expense to the east of the bridge. There are no weight restriction signs to the north of the bridge (Greenwich) or to the west of the bridge (Lewisham).

It was full last Friday. It is the bin for cardboard. We have other two bins but they only have bottle holes which means residents are forced to place recyclables into the normal waste bins. This problem has existed for years and been exacerbated by COVID. It has been documented and reported to Lewisham Council and Pinnacle since March 2020 and neither has done anything to try to fix the problem so recyclables are literally wasted and Lewisham Council does not care and no-one is held to account as both Pinnacle and Lewisham Council point the finger at the other.,Recycling bin full again,open,-0.034977,desktop,Missed Collection,2021-06-06T09:54:27+01:00,2021-06-02T19:09:42+01:00,Missed Collection,2764526,2021-06-02T19:09:39+01:00,['Lewisham Borough Council'],,1.0

I have reported this to Pinnacle, Regenter and Lewisham Council and none have taken any action to resolve this, they just put the finger at the other.

Two of our recycling bins are full again. One (the cardboard bin) has been full for a week, the other (bottle) for a few days. The third bin with bottle slots may only be partially used so residents have no choice but to put cardboard and other items in the normal waste bins.

Because of Lewisham Council and Pinnacle's ongoing neglect approx 25-30% of our recyclables have been placed in the wrong bins for over a year. Neither care about this and apparently no-one is accountable.

I reported the situation of residents at 38 and 38A leaving their Bins outside their properties obstructing the pavement for many days at a time and Fly tipping unwanted household items on the pavement outside their homes on the 3rd of May but evidently Lewisham Council have still not contacted them to instruct them to stop doing that as it is still happening:

Today - Monday 17th May some of the Bins have been left out [again] on the pavement since last Wednesday`s Bin emptying day.

They regularly leave either all 4 Bins or 2 of them out obstructing the pavement for many days - often more than a week.

I originally posted a report about that because it was obstructing the pavement when I was going past with my child`s buggy especially when other people were trying to walk past the bins - I sometimes have had to go out into the road to wait for people to pass the bins before proceeding - not desirable with a child in a buggy.

At no point since I reported this problem 12 days ago have all of the bins been put back onto the residents property / removed from the pavement.

Now one of the residents has put a large orange coloured Gas bottle outside on the pavement.

I wonder if there is still Gas in the bottle ?

I feel that this could be very dangerous if for example an inquisitive child tried to turn it on not realising that they should not touch it.

It is NOT good enough for the Council to just categorise this report / complaint as something like: `Passed to the Highways Department` - I cannot remember the exact term used for my previous report.","A Large orange Gas Bottle has been put out onto pavement by residents of either number 38 or 38A Holdenby Road:
