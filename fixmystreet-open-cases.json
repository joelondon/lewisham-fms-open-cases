The kids are aged 3-6 on that side and so it would be great if the mess could be removed asap. It’s all the way from around no96 all the way past the school on the school side. As I said there is poop next to every single planted tree. I’m going to report it to the council and see if some signs can be sprayed on the pavement.\n\nThanks Tracy",
