Documented complaints have been made to both but still no action has been taken. Our bins were full before Easter and were not emptied this week so again residents have to use the normal waste bins to dispose of recyclables. Lewisham Council's contractors do not have the capacity to manage and deliver this contract to the required collection frequency and the estate does not have enough bins to cope with increased bin pressures due to COVID behavioural changes. The bins have not been contaminated but regardless of the evidence this seems to be the Council's go to excuse for not have enough refuse collecting capacity.",
