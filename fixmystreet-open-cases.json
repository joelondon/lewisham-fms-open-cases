The Council then said the issue was due to contamination even though no red tags had been placed on the bins for a year. In the last month red contamination tags have been placed on the bins, after the bins were already full, and these tags have remained full for days after, so like the previous 15 months residents have been forced to place recyclables in the normal waste bins because of a lack of recycling bin capacity. Pinnacle (Regenter) have said that Lewisham Council is responsible for bin capacity and Lewisham Council has stated that Pinnacle (Regenter) is responsible so for over a year 1/4-1/3 of our recyclables have gone into normal waste bins and no-one is accountable for this.\n\nLewisham Council's default for these issues is to blame residents and state contamination.
