    "description": "Huge pile of construction waste: This is the third time I have posted about this issue. I do not know why my post is repeatedly removed. There is a huge pile of construction waste dumped on the corner of Billingford Close and Pincott Place, just at the turning off Frendsbury Road. It is a very large mound of excavated earth, bricks, junks of concrete, painted road tarmac, wooden boards, electricity cables, and large white construction waste bags. This is not domestic waste, this is from a construction site.",
