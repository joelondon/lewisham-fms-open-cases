You said it would be removed but would take some time as specialist equipment for the height had to be sourced. This has never been cleaned off and everyday everyone has to put up with it in the middle of our town. I think it’s a terrible advert for Lewisham and I’m shocked it’s just been left. Unfortunately with the Queen’s passing now an even worse situation has happened, by accident I don’t doubt - her photo is now on the bill board adjacent to the inappropriate language in the graphitti. It urgently needs to be addressed as it is extremely upsetting and disrespectful to just leave it like this. If you still can’t clean off the graphitti surely you can get the screen switched off - please don’t just leave it like this as it is horrible for everyone who respects our town and abides by law & order rather than taking it into their own hands for no gain - it’s not acceptable to have to look at this whilst we mourn the Queen.
