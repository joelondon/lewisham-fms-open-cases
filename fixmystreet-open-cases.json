Has effectively blocked off the lower part of the road.\n\nAlso, both low-loaders, whether parked on Rubens Street or Cameron Road are leaking diesel constantly, as evidenced by all the stains on the road.\n\nPlease do something, it is not a commercial business road, it is residential. If they want to run a business from the rented flat, please go to an area where it is acceptable.\n\nSILVER FORD DIESEL 3.5 TONNE - LD19 SVS SILVER FORD DIESEL 3.5 TONNE - EY51 ZSG\n\nPhotos available if needed.",
