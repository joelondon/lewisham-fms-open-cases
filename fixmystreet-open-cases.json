I suspect there needs to be a better communal system rather than every individual flat having their own bin.\n\nToday I saw some rats by the bins although I didn’t get chance to photograph before they scurried off.

TfL apparently don’t accept that buses can damage houses 🙄 The bus company have apparently however asked drivers to drive slower, but as stated many of them hit the bumps at speed. A solution might be to cut grooves in the speed bumps to accommodate the buses’ wheels, or to re-route the bus route (though that could inconvenience the school), but something more than driver education needs to be done.",
