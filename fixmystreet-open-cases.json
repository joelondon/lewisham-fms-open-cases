    "detail": "This pothole has been here for AGES. I reported a long time ago and it’s still not been fixed. It’s actually gotten bigger since I first reporter it and appears to be sinking. It sits next to what appears to be a water mains supply stopcock on the walkway in front of Lewisham Park Towers. It’s close to the front of the Kemsley block building.",
