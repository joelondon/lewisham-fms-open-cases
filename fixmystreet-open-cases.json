I'm not even sure if Lewisham deals with these types of issues (I've read that some councils do). Property 124, has a few untidy areas that need sorting. I've already reported fly-tipping at the front and here I'm reporting (1) an untidy terrace straight outside our bedroom window; and (2) an abandoned garden with blackberry aggressively spreading and overspilling into other properties/gardens. Again, apologies if this is not the right place to report such an issue. I do hope there's a chance that Lewisham council could encourage the owners to tidy up those areas. Thank you",
