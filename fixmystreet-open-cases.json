It surely needs someone from LBC to look at the state of the High Street and come up with something more positive to clear the problem.\n\nWhat's happened to the CCTV cameras in the High Street. I'm sure the shop keepers can offer some help, it can't do their business much good trading in such a messy Street. The police must know the tags and the names/addresses of the people causing the damage Shops should not be allowed to sell spray paint or marker pens to under 21's.",
