They then cause a commotion by driving loudly and quickly back up Kangley Bridge Road toward Stanton Way. Every Sunday, usually around 11pm. Our guess would be that they gather in commercial buildings / parking lots that aren't guarded on a weekend. This is a fairly busy road, but the traffic is largely unnoticeable generally speaking. These vehicles however cause a massive disruption -- partly b/c of number and speed, partly because at least half of them seem to be fitted with loud engines. Very disruptive activity and seems to be regular. Has been going on for at least a few weeks now.",
