    "description": "Dangerous car parking on corner near Co-op: Cars are parking vertically on the corner of Stanstead Road and Rockbourn Road & obstruct the left view of motorists emerging from Rockbourn Road causing them to get into the centre of the road. Personally had three near accidents at that point because of this. Cars are parked outside the new Co-op so cars heading towards the 205 from Stanstead Road are already overtaking parked cars at that point and meet any vehicle emerging from Rockbourn Road. This issue has been reported to the local Councillor and has been an issue for many months."
