    "description": "Problem not fixed: Stones in Calmont Road: Despite numerous responses today that the problem is fixed, it isn't.\n\nWhilst most stones are not on the Calmont Road carriageway, they are on the Hillbrow Road carriageway. As the photos show, road markings indicating a bump in the road are partially covered and the direct route used by pedestrians crossing Hillbrow is covered by stones. These are particularly difficult to walk on for those in 'equality' categories eg the elderly, infirm and carers with prams. Further more, because the stones are in very close proximity to Calmont Road (and generally are all over it), this is dangerous for cyclists and in addition, car wheels can flick the stones into the air dangerously.",
