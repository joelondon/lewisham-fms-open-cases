As a resident of priestfield road wouldn't it have been nice to be advised of this closure before it happened especially since there is no left turn at the bell green junction so I had to go over to spine road to be able to come home via perry hill. There appears to be inadequate signage in Perry rise on the approach to this work to say road ahead is closed!!! Come on lewisham what happened to communication. I also found out from a Conway worker that it will be closed for 4 weeks so it is not a minor inconvenience. I would be interested to hear your views and comments. Thanks",
