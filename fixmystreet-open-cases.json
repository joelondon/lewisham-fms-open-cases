    "description": "Heavy electric buses are making our houses shake: Neighbours up and down the whole length of Sprules Road, ourselves included (at number 3), are complaining about our houses jolting and shaking violently whenever the new exceedingly heavy electric buses hit the speed bumps. Some of the driver go a little slower and the jolt is less noticeable but many hit the bumps without slowing and our houses jump as they do. Many neighbours have noticed new cracks and damage since the electric buses arrived in March 2021. We are all worrying about damage to the fascias, walls, and possibly even subsidence if the problem isn’t solved. The council is passing the buck to TfL. TfL apparently don’t accept that buses can damage houses 🙄 The bus company have apparently however asked drivers to drive slower, but as stated many of them hit the bumps at speed. A solution might be to cut grooves in the speed bumps to accommodate the buses’ wheels, or to re-route the bus route (though that could inconvenience the school), but something more than driver education needs to be done.",

    "detail": "Neighbours up and down the whole length of Sprules Road, ourselves included (at number 3), are complaining about our houses jolting and shaking violently whenever the new exceedingly heavy electric buses hit the speed bumps. Some of the driver go a little slower and the jolt is less noticeable but many hit the bumps without slowing and our houses jump as they do. Many neighbours have noticed new cracks and damage since the electric buses arrived in March 2021. We are all worrying about damage to the fascias, walls, and possibly even subsidence if the problem isn’t solved. The council is passing the buck to TfL. TfL apparently don’t accept that buses can damage houses 🙄 The bus company have apparently however asked drivers to drive slower, but as stated many of them hit the bumps at speed. A solution might be to cut grooves in the speed bumps to accommodate the buses’ wheels, or to re-route the bus route (though that could inconvenience the school), but something more than driver education needs to be done.",

This is misleading and does not solve problems. Recycling bins are full long before collection dates, and even if there is contamination (which was not the case for over a year because no red tags) the contamination is limited and does not explain why the bins are full.\n\nOverflowing recycling bins are then left for days, sometimes a week so residents have no choice but to throw away recyclables in normal waste bins.\n\nLewisham Council and Pinnacle's complaints system is based on apathy and grinding residents down so that their expectations are low enough to meet the Council's dismal and misleading standards.",

We have other two bins but they only have bottle holes which means residents are forced to place recyclables into the normal waste bins. This problem has existed for years and been exacerbated by COVID. It has been documented and reported to Lewisham Council and Pinnacle since March 2020 and neither has done anything to try to fix the problem so recyclables are literally wasted and Lewisham Council does not care and no-one is held to account as both Pinnacle and Lewisham Council point the finger at the other.",

This is just outside of 312, where a major redevelopment of the building converting what was a large house into into luxury flats is currently underway - perhaps why this patch of tarmac is now in such bad condition with large vehicles delivering and operating at the site entrance and so on.\n\nNot only is this a safety issue for road users but also pedestrians as stones are getting constantly thrown onto the pavement and hitting the residential walls - especially with current bad, wintry weather. In addition to this, as is/was with the potholes around here they are also causing extra noise and vibrations to the properties.\n\nPlease look into resurfacing this stretch, as has been done further along asap.

    "detail": "This issue relates to the large potholes that have been an issue in this area of Brownhill Road.\n\nLeading the lights to the junction of Brownhill and Torridon there is a large stretch (about a lorry in length) of really loose and uneven road. This is just outside of 312, where a major redevelopment of the building converting what was a large house into into luxury flats is currently underway - perhaps why this patch of tarmac is now in such bad condition with large vehicles delivering and operating at the site entrance and so on.\n\nNot only is this a safety issue for road users but also pedestrians as stones are getting constantly thrown onto the pavement and hitting the residential walls - especially with current bad, wintry weather. In addition to this, as is/was with the potholes around here they are also causing extra noise and vibrations to the properties.\n\nPlease look into resurfacing this stretch, as has been done further along asap. Thank you.",
