Our guess would be that they gather in commercial buildings / parking lots that aren't guarded on a weekend. This is a fairly busy road, but the traffic is largely unnoticeable generally speaking. These vehicles however cause a massive disruption -- partly b/c of number and speed, partly because at least half of them seem to be fitted with loud engines.

This is just outside of 312, where a major redevelopment of the building converting what was a large house into into luxury flats is currently underway - perhaps why this patch of tarmac is now in such bad condition with large vehicles delivering and operating at the site entrance and so on.\n\nNot only is this a safety issue for road users but also pedestrians as stones are getting constantly thrown onto the pavement and hitting the residential walls - especially with current bad, wintry weather. In addition to this, as is/was with the potholes around here they are also causing extra noise and vibrations to the properties.\n\nPlease look into resurfacing this stretch, as has been done further along asap.

    "detail": "This issue relates to the large potholes that have been an issue in this area of Brownhill Road.\n\nLeading the lights to the junction of Brownhill and Torridon there is a large stretch (about a lorry in length) of really loose and uneven road. This is just outside of 312, where a major redevelopment of the building converting what was a large house into into luxury flats is currently underway - perhaps why this patch of tarmac is now in such bad condition with large vehicles delivering and operating at the site entrance and so on.\n\nNot only is this a safety issue for road users but also pedestrians as stones are getting constantly thrown onto the pavement and hitting the residential walls - especially with current bad, wintry weather. In addition to this, as is/was with the potholes around here they are also causing extra noise and vibrations to the properties.\n\nPlease look into resurfacing this stretch, as has been done further along asap. Thank you.",
