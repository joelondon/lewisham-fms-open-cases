The weeds are a tripping hazard for people unsteady on their feet, but they are also unsightly and perhaps that untidiness, and apparent lack of care for our surroundings, contributes to passersby feeling they can litter and fly tip along the length of the road. Finally, soil seems to accumulate where the road surface meets the curbside, and that again provides much food for new crops of weeds to sprout.
