Rude.\n\nThe number plates are removed and hidden which is an offence. If you sent someone there you would know that for yourself instead of expecting the public to spoon feed you the information.\n\nThere's also a set of metal gates that goes to Phoenix community councils new building site opposite all the guys vans, this has rubbish dumped there also.\n\nYou totally ignored the fact that there's oil all over the pavement, car parts scattered everywhere and other automotive fluids due to this persons actions.
