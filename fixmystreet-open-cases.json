This is misleading and does not solve problems. Recycling bins are full long before collection dates, and even if there is contamination (which was not the case for over a year because no red tags) the contamination is limited and does not explain why the bins are full.\n\nOverflowing recycling bins are then left for days, sometimes a week so residents have no choice but to throw away recyclables in normal waste bins.\n\nLewisham Council and Pinnacle's complaints system is based on apathy and grinding residents down so that their expectations are low enough to meet the Council's dismal and misleading standards.",
