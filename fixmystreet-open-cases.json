Some of the driver go a little slower and the jolt is less noticeable but many hit the bumps without slowing and our houses jump as they do. Many neighbours have noticed new cracks and damage since the electric buses arrived in March 2021. We are all worrying about damage to the fascias, walls, and possibly even subsidence if the problem isn’t solved. The council is passing the buck to TfL. TfL apparently don’t accept that buses can damage houses 🙄 The bus company have apparently however asked drivers to drive slower, but as stated many of them hit the bumps at speed. A solution might be to cut grooves in the speed bumps to accommodate the buses’ wheels, or to re-route the bus route (though that could inconvenience the school), but something more than driver education needs to be done.",

For over one year Pinnacle ignored these requests and Lewisham Council stated there was adequate bin capacity regardless of the photos. The Council then said the issue was due to contamination even though no red tags had been placed on the bins for a year. In the last month red contamination tags have been placed on the bins, after the bins were already full, and these tags have remained full for days after, so like the previous 15 months residents have been forced to place recyclables in the normal waste bins because of a lack of recycling bin capacity.
