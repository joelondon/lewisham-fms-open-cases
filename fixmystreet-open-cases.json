    "description": "Non cutting of grass and privets: The 'green chain walk' in Woodbank Road has not had the grass cut for nearly 3 months. even during lockdown a person with a strimmer or ride on mower could have kept this down. other areas too. green on the corner of Capstone Road and Lame Rock Road also the one in the road with no name between Moorside Road and Capstone Road - opposite the Good Shepard church [PW / Education Facility on your map} both side of the road are very over grown and there has been a tin 'unit' put on there for months. looks like a council thing. also overgrown privets making it impossible to walk on the pavement when cars are also, badly, parked. corner of Moorside Road and Whitefoot Terrace. Corner of Capstone Road and Durham Hill come to mind",
