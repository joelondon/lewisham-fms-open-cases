Our guess would be that they gather in commercial buildings / parking lots that aren't guarded on a weekend. This is a fairly busy road, but the traffic is largely unnoticeable generally speaking.

Some of the driver go a little slower and the jolt is less noticeable but many hit the bumps without slowing and our houses jump as they do. Many neighbours have noticed new cracks and damage since the electric buses arrived in March 2021. We are all worrying about damage to the fascias, walls, and possibly even subsidence if the problem isn’t solved. The council is passing the buck to TfL. TfL apparently don’t accept that buses can damage houses 🙄 The bus company have apparently however asked drivers to drive slower, but as stated many of them hit the bumps at speed. A solution might be to cut grooves in the speed bumps to accommodate the buses’ wheels, or to re-route the bus route (though that could inconvenience the school), but something more than driver education needs to be done.",

I have reported it before and nothing has been done. It is an eyesore and the plants and foliage fall across the path. I’ve had to go out and trim some back myself. The foliage etc needs to be chopped back. When Glendale or whatever company is contacted now, come to do the mowing and gardening in Pagoda Gardens Estate they forget or fail to do any maintenance in this area. Why? It is an area of council land and should be kept tidy. Aren’t I paying my council tax for this? Please can this area be tidied up as it’s making this road (in a conservation area look shabby).",

For over one year Pinnacle ignored these requests and Lewisham Council stated there was adequate bin capacity regardless of the photos. The Council then said the issue was due to contamination even though no red tags had been placed on the bins for a year. In the last month red contamination tags have been placed on the bins, after the bins were already full, and these tags have remained full for days after, so like the previous 15 months residents have been forced to place recyclables in the normal waste bins because of a lack of recycling bin capacity. Pinnacle (Regenter) have said that Lewisham Council is responsible for bin capacity and Lewisham Council has stated that Pinnacle (Regenter) is responsible so for over a year 1/4-1/3 of our recyclables have gone into normal waste bins and no-one is accountable for this.\n\nLewisham Council's default for these issues is to blame residents and state contamination. This is misleading and does not solve problems. Recycling bins are full long before collection dates, and even if there is contamination (which was not the case for over a year because no red tags) the contamination is limited and does not explain why the bins are full.\n\nOverflowing recycling bins are then left for days, sometimes a week so residents have no choice but to throw away recyclables in normal waste bins.\n\nLewisham Council and Pinnacle's complaints system is based on apathy and grinding residents down so that their expectations are low enough to meet the Council's dismal and misleading standards.",

    "detail": "For over one year residents have documented and reported a lack of recycling bin capacity for the block which is due to inappropriate bin lid types which means only one bin may be used. For over one year Pinnacle ignored these requests and Lewisham Council stated there was adequate bin capacity regardless of the photos. The Council then said the issue was due to contamination even though no red tags had been placed on the bins for a year. In the last month red contamination tags have been placed on the bins, after the bins were already full, and these tags have remained full for days after, so like the previous 15 months residents have been forced to place recyclables in the normal waste bins because of a lack of recycling bin capacity. Pinnacle (Regenter) have said that Lewisham Council is responsible for bin capacity and Lewisham Council has stated that Pinnacle (Regenter) is responsible so for over a year 1/4-1/3 of our recyclables have gone into normal waste bins and no-one is accountable for this.\n\nLewisham Council's default for these issues is to blame residents and state contamination. This is misleading and does not solve problems. Recycling bins are full long before collection dates, and even if there is contamination (which was not the case for over a year because no red tags) the contamination is limited and does not explain why the bins are full.\n\nOverflowing recycling bins are then left for days, sometimes a week so residents have no choice but to throw away recyclables in normal waste bins.\n\nLewisham Council and Pinnacle's complaints system is based on apathy and grinding residents down so that their expectations are low enough to meet the Council's dismal and misleading standards.",
