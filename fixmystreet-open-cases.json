    "description": "Emergency access issues for old people's home/council home: On Steele Road, off Campshill Road there is an old people's home (Linden Court) - SE13 6BS, opposite the back of Lewisham Homes' Chiddingstone - SE13 6QY.\n\nThere is a car park there, one side for those who access Linden Court (with permits) and one side for those in Chiddingstone.\n\nThere are number of issues resulting in people from Chiddingstone causing many issues with not following parking rules/a lack of clear marking from the Highways Agency/Lewisham Council.\n\n1) On the actual corner of the turn in to Steele Road a van and other cars, constantly park, meaning that the road left available is not wide enough for any cars to get through smoothly, let alone fire or ambulance services. This is absolutely crucial as there are multiple level blocks here and in the event of a fire, the emergency services will not be able to access. There is no double yellow lines here either - a simple solution would be to put double yellow lines on both side here - including on the pavement where some drivers think it's ok to park too - there are multiple wheelchair users in the area and they block that too.\n\n2) A BT van consistently parks, sticking out into the road on the Linden Court spaces, outside of the grid allocated, please serve notice on this van to respect the rules.\n\n3) Chiddingstone Resident/Visitor cars are now double-parking all along Steele Road, causing less access for the buildings, again, this is an issue for emergency access and for buses and vans to use Linden Court.\n\n4) Chiddingstone Resident/Visitor are now parking outside the front of Linden Court where there are no markings. this is blocking access again.
