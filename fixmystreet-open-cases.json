Sustrans confirm not their responsibility in following email...\n\n' Hi Philip,\n\nI must apologise, in my email to you on Monday I mistakenly provided you with false information, for which I am very sorry. Sustrans doesn’t own the land underneath the railway tracks here. In the 10 years our Project Manager in London has been at Sustrans, they are not aware that we have ever been involved in cleaning or maintaining it.\n\nIt was about 20 year ago that we got a licence from Network Rail that enabled us to open this route, but this never equated to ownership of this section, which likely lies with the Lewisham authorities.\n\nThe Project Manager has suggested that the student accommodation, which has been there for 7 years now, could be taking some responsibility for the maintenance of this path too. They contacted the London Volunteer Coordinator who has confirmed that their team have had nothing to do with this path and unfortunately can’t commit their team to help here due to them being at capacity with projects on land we do own already.\n\nTo address the error in the information I passed on to you, I have contacted my colleagues in the GIS team to update the map to reflect that we have never owned this section.\n\nI am sorry that this response will look like passing the buck, and I apologise again for passing on incorrect information to you on Monday. The best way to get this addressed would be to go through Lewisham.\n\nBest wishes,\n\nCallum Rickard\n\nSupporter Care Officer | Fundraising & Supporter Engagement | Sustrans\n\n2 Cathedral Square | College Green | Bristol | BS1 5DD'",

This is absolutely crucial as there are multiple level blocks here and in the event of a fire, the emergency services will not be able to access. There is no double yellow lines here either - a simple solution would be to put double yellow lines on both side here - including on the pavement where some drivers think it's ok to park too - there are multiple wheelchair users in the area and they block that too.\n\n2) A BT van consistently parks, sticking out into the road on the Linden Court spaces, outside of the grid allocated, please serve notice on this van to respect the rules.\n\n3) Chiddingstone Resident/Visitor cars are now double-parking all along Steele Road, causing less access for the buildings, again, this is an issue for emergency access and for buses and vans to use Linden Court.\n\n4) Chiddingstone Resident/Visitor are now parking outside the front of Linden Court where there are no markings. this is blocking access again. Again, please mark this area clearly as no parking.\n\n5) Chiddingstone Resident/Visitor cars are not diagonally parking in the spaces, again causing less room for maneuvering around.\n\nPlease action a) the markings and b) provide warnings for both Chiddingstone Residents and Linden Court to respect the car park AND crucially please instruct your army of parking wardens who regularly hand out fines for Lewisham Park and are in the vicinity all the time, to work on Steele Road when you have found a solution.

    "detail": "On Steele Road, off Campshill Road there is an old people's home (Linden Court) - SE13 6BS, opposite the back of Lewisham Homes' Chiddingstone - SE13 6QY.\n\nThere is a car park there, one side for those who access Linden Court (with permits) and one side for those in Chiddingstone.\n\nThere are number of issues resulting in people from Chiddingstone causing many issues with not following parking rules/a lack of clear marking from the Highways Agency/Lewisham Council.\n\n1) On the actual corner of the turn in to Steele Road a van and other cars, constantly park, meaning that the road left available is not wide enough for any cars to get through smoothly, let alone fire or ambulance services. This is absolutely crucial as there are multiple level blocks here and in the event of a fire, the emergency services will not be able to access. There is no double yellow lines here either - a simple solution would be to put double yellow lines on both side here - including on the pavement where some drivers think it's ok to park too - there are multiple wheelchair users in the area and they block that too.\n\n2) A BT van consistently parks, sticking out into the road on the Linden Court spaces, outside of the grid allocated, please serve notice on this van to respect the rules.\n\n3) Chiddingstone Resident/Visitor cars are now double-parking all along Steele Road, causing less access for the buildings, again, this is an issue for emergency access and for buses and vans to use Linden Court.\n\n4) Chiddingstone Resident/Visitor are now parking outside the front of Linden Court where there are no markings. this is blocking access again. Again, please mark this area clearly as no parking.\n\n5) Chiddingstone Resident/Visitor cars are not diagonally parking in the spaces, again causing less room for maneuvering around.\n\nPlease action a) the markings and b) provide warnings for both Chiddingstone Residents and Linden Court to respect the car park AND crucially please instruct your army of parking wardens who regularly hand out fines for Lewisham Park and are in the vicinity all the time, to work on Steele Road when you have found a solution. Thanks, from a worried visitor.",

This mess is now down the wall below and over the windows of the two flats below.\n\nLewisham Homes do not manage the whole of Stephens Court. However, they do rent flat 5 from the owner to provide social housing. Please can you check this as my other report was rejected.\n\nPlease can you arrange for someone from Lewisham Homes to attend and clean this up. Thank you.",
