    "detail": "Hello, An unknown substance has been poured/spilled out of a window belonging to a Lewisham Homes property (flat 5 Stephens Court, 82 Endwell Road). This mess is now down the wall below and over the windows of the two flats below.\n\nLewisham Homes do not manage the whole of Stephens Court. However, they do rent flat 5 from the owner to provide social housing. Please can you check this as my other report was rejected.\n\nPlease can you arrange for someone from Lewisham Homes to attend and clean this up. Thank you.",
