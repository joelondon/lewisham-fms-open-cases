I will not use your own report system, I will continue to use FIX MY STREET as it leaves it publicly for all to see.\n\nMultiple vehicles, no number plate, all being stripped down for parts on the PAVEMENT. Where people are meant to walk. Engine oil, gearbox oils and other car fluids have totally stained the pavements here.\n\nLoads of rubbish dumped in and around the vehicles. It's quite obvious a local resident which I know you have already had dealings with, is just allowed to go using the public highway for his commercial dealings.\n\nAll crap in the road for people to get punctures, items dumped on the grass, neighbor allowing the guy to use his front garden to store old tyres, pallets and all other rubbish.\n\nLast time there was 5 children sitting in all this oil sifting through wiring looms. . sorting out car parts like this is some sort of 3rd dump.\n\nBut you, Lewisham council say there is a lack of evidence.

There are no weight restriction signs to the north of the bridge (Greenwich) or to the west of the bridge (Lewisham).\n\nLewisham assert that the bridge now has a 40T weight limit (presumably believing it has been strengthened) and they gleaned this information from Bromley.\n\nEither Bromley has squandered taxpayers' money on the new sign or Lewisham has made a mistake in removing the 10T limit signs.\n\nTo further confuse matters, there is a second bridge over the River Quaggy this time on Mottingham Lane, again on the boundary of Bromley and Greenwich, but with Greenwich the highway authority. Could it be that this bridge has the 10T limit.\n\nWhatever the answer, this matter needs investigating as a matter of urgency, and the investigation should include liaising with Lewisham and Greenwich highway authorities to get to the bottom of this matter and ensuring that all three highway authorities display the correct signage for the bridge.",

West of the bridge Lewisham is the highway authority, and north of the bridge Greenwich is the highway authority.\n\nShown in the picture is the shiny new 10T weight restriction sign installed at Bromley taxpayers' expense to the east of the bridge. There are no weight restriction signs to the north of the bridge (Greenwich) or to the west of the bridge (Lewisham).\n\nLewisham assert that the bridge now has a 40T weight limit (presumably believing it has been strengthened) and they gleaned this information from Bromley.\n\nEither Bromley has squandered taxpayers' money on the new sign or Lewisham has made a mistake in removing the 10T limit signs.\n\nTo further confuse matters, there is a second bridge over the River Quaggy this time on Mottingham Lane, again on the boundary of Bromley and Greenwich, but with Greenwich the highway authority. Could it be that this bridge has the 10T limit.\n\nWhatever the answer, this matter needs investigating as a matter of urgency, and the investigation should include liaising with Lewisham and Greenwich highway authorities to get to the bottom of this matter and ensuring that all three highway authorities display the correct signage for the bridge."
