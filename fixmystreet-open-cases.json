Pedestrians are forced to go to outer edge of pavement where traffic veers inwards towards the pavement due to road layout. Groups of parents and children with buggies accessing nearby primary school have to navigate around it, often onto the road and many pavement users are unable to safely use this pavement at all. This hedge has not been maintained for several years."
