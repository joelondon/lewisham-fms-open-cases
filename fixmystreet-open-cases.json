    "description": "Heavy electric buses are making our houses shake: Neighbours up and down the whole length of Sprules Road, ourselves included (at number 3), are complaining about our houses jolting and shaking violently whenever the new exceedingly heavy electric buses hit the speed bumps. Some of the driver go a little slower and the jolt is less noticeable but many hit the bumps without slowing and our houses jump as they do. Many neighbours have noticed new cracks and damage since the electric buses arrived in March 2021. We are all worrying about damage to the fascias, walls, and possibly even subsidence if the problem isn’t solved. The council is passing the buck to TfL. TfL apparently don’t accept that buses can damage houses 🙄 The bus company have apparently however asked drivers to drive slower, but as stated many of them hit the bumps at speed.
