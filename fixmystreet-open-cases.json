The shelter has a TfL ref number on it as you can see from the photographs and not a JC Decaux signage.\n\nFor avoidance of doubt it is this shelter:\n\nHttps://www.instantstreetview.com/@51.455179,0.017034,147.55h,0.32p,2.72z,J90pp1qTXG-_5OQv1YTxFw\n\nThank you"

Could it be that this bridge has the 10T limit.\n\nWhatever the answer, this matter needs investigating as a matter of urgency, and the investigation should include liaising with Lewisham and Greenwich highway authorities to get to the bottom of this matter and ensuring that all three highway authorities display the correct signage for the bridge.",
