    "description": "Brick pillar on corner of St Margaret's Square knocked down: Last year a brick pillar on the western corner of St Margaret's Square fell down - perhaps it was hit by a vehicle. Someone has moved it from the middle of the pavement and into the hedge, which is nice, but the smashed up brickwork remains on its side. It's unsightly and needs rebuilding in line with the rules for the conservation area.",
