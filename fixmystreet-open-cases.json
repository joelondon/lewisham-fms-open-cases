    "description": "Recycling bins not collected again: For over a year Lewisham Council has failed to consistently collect the recycling bins for this Regenter (Pinnacle) managed block. Documented complaints have been made to both but still no action has been taken. Our bins were full before Easter and were not emptied this week so again residents have to use the normal waste bins to dispose of recyclables. Lewisham Council's contractors do not have the capacity to manage and deliver this contract to the required collection frequency and the estate does not have enough bins to cope with increased bin pressures due to COVID behavioural changes. The bins have not been contaminated but regardless of the evidence this seems to be the Council's go to excuse for not have enough refuse collecting capacity.",

As the photos show, road markings indicating a bump in the road are partially covered and the direct route used by pedestrians crossing Hillbrow is covered by stones. These are particularly difficult to walk on for those in 'equality' categories eg the elderly, infirm and carers with prams. Further more, because the stones are in very close proximity to Calmont Road (and generally are all over it), this is dangerous for cyclists and in addition, car wheels can flick the stones into the air dangerously.",
