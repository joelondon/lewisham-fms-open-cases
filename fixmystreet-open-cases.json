I originally reported this incident on 7th February 2022 to James however nothing has been done unfortunately and the fence continues to get weaker. The fence is now leaning back and is only a matter of time before it falls completely. Please can you advise. Many thanks",

I'm not even sure if Lewisham deals with these types of issues (I've read that some councils do). Property 124, has a few untidy areas that need sorting. I've already reported fly-tipping at the front and here I'm reporting (1) an untidy terrace straight outside our bedroom window; and (2) an abandoned garden with blackberry aggressively spreading and overspilling into other properties/gardens. Again, apologies if this is not the right place to report such an issue. I do hope there's a chance that Lewisham council could encourage the owners to tidy up those areas. Thank you",

Rubbish being thrown on to Site of Importance for Nature Conservation via this massive hole.: The sections of pulled down fence are huge now and various issues as a result - people can get on to the land and damage/vandalise the scout hut & SINC site all listed with Lewisham as assets of community value. Rubbish being dumped on the site and pathway obstructed with fencing.",
