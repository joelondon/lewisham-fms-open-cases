Many neighbours have noticed new cracks and damage since the electric buses arrived in March 2021. We are all worrying about damage to the fascias, walls, and possibly even subsidence if the problem isn’t solved. The council is passing the buck to TfL. TfL apparently don’t accept that buses can damage houses 🙄 The bus company have apparently however asked drivers to drive slower, but as stated many of them hit the bumps at speed. A solution might be to cut grooves in the speed bumps to accommodate the buses’ wheels, or to re-route the bus route (though that could inconvenience the school), but something more than driver education needs to be done.",
