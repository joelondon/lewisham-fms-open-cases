This is absolutely crucial as there are multiple level blocks here and in the event of a fire, the emergency services will not be able to access. There is no double yellow lines here either - a simple solution would be to put double yellow lines on both side here - including on the pavement where some drivers think it's ok to park too - there are multiple wheelchair users in the area and they block that too.\n\n2) A BT van consistently parks, sticking out into the road on the Linden Court spaces, outside of the grid allocated, please serve notice on this van to respect the rules.\n\n3) Chiddingstone Resident/Visitor cars are now double-parking all along Steele Road, causing less access for the buildings, again, this is an issue for emergency access and for buses and vans to use Linden Court.\n\n4) Chiddingstone Resident/Visitor are now parking outside the front of Linden Court where there are no markings. this is blocking access again. Again, please mark this area clearly as no parking.\n\n5) Chiddingstone Resident/Visitor cars are not diagonally parking in the spaces, again causing less room for maneuvering around.\n\nPlease action a) the markings and b) provide warnings for both Chiddingstone Residents and Linden Court to respect the car park AND crucially please instruct your army of parking wardens who regularly hand out fines for Lewisham Park and are in the vicinity all the time, to work on Steele Road when you have found a solution.

It surely needs someone from LBC to look at the state of the High Street and come up with something more positive to clear the problem.\n\nWhat's happened to the CCTV cameras in the High Street. I'm sure the shop keepers can offer some help, it can't do their business much good trading in such a messy Street. The police must know the tags and the names/addresses of the people causing the damage Shops should not be allowed to sell spray paint or marker pens to under 21's.",
