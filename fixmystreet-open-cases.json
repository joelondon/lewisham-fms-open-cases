One bin is full and the two others are at 80-90% because regardless of the missed collection we lack bin capacity.

Neither Lewisham Council or Regenter (Pinnacle) will take responsibility for these ongoing failings which mean 1/4-1/3 of our recylcling has to be placed in normal waste bins. Both Lewisham Council and Pinnacle have stated that the other is responsible and their is no mechanism to hold either to account under the failed Regenter RB3 PFI contract"
