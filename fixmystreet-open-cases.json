I will not use your own report system, I will continue to use FIX MY STREET as it leaves it publicly for all to see.\n\nMultiple vehicles, no number plate, all being stripped down for parts on the PAVEMENT. Where people are meant to walk. Engine oil, gearbox oils and other car fluids have totally stained the pavements here.\n\nLoads of rubbish dumped in and around the vehicles. It's quite obvious a local resident which I know you have already had dealings with, is just allowed to go using the public highway for his commercial dealings.\n\nAll crap in the road for people to get punctures, items dumped on the grass, neighbor allowing the guy to use his front garden to store old tyres, pallets and all other rubbish.\n\nLast time there was 5 children sitting in all this oil sifting through wiring looms. . sorting out car parts like this is some sort of 3rd dump.\n\nBut you, Lewisham council say there is a lack of evidence.
