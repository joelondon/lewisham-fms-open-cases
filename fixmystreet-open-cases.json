When windy it dangerously blows around without restraint and could hit someone and cause serious injury. My neighbour is 5ft 10 and as you can see it could easily hit him on the head. It is not the 6ft 10 as written on the other height restrictor. Also, although it has locking and unlocking facilities (to allow access to those vans legally allowed to use the car park). However, for ease of use, the vans prefer to go in and out of the broken height restrictor and leave it open for this purpose. this causes utter misery for us residents as it clangs away morning, noon and night, causing 24/7 noise pollution. Please, can we work together to find a solution for the vans to use the car park in such a way that doesn't disturb the residents trying to live and sleep peacefully in their homes.",
