A car crashed into the wall and demolished the brick wall (behind the bins in the photo) and the fence (as visible in the photo). The car nearly killed me walking on the pavement too, and the speed people drive down Brookmill Road is therefore a far larger issue. Don't wait until someone dies to do something.
