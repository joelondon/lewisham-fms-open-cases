We have other two bins but they only have bottle holes which means residents are forced to place recyclables into the normal waste bins.

It has been documented and reported to Lewisham Council and Pinnacle since March 2020 and neither has done anything to try to fix the problem so recyclables are literally wasted and Lewisham Council does not care and no-one is held to account as both Pinnacle and Lewisham Council point the finger at the other.",

This is just outside of 312, where a major redevelopment of the building converting what was a large house into into luxury flats is currently underway - perhaps why this patch of tarmac is now in such bad condition with large vehicles delivering and operating at the site entrance and so on.\n\nNot only is this a safety issue for road users but also pedestrians as stones are getting constantly thrown onto the pavement and hitting the residential walls - especially with current bad, wintry weather. In addition to this, as is/was with the potholes around here they are also causing extra noise and vibrations to the properties.\n\nPlease look into resurfacing this stretch, as has been done further along asap. Thank you.",
