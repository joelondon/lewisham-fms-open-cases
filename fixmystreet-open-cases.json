    "description": "Massively overgrown weeds the length of Sprules Road: The pavements and curbs along the length of Sprules Road (on both sides) have been covered in weeds for the last 18 months. In summer 2021 residents spent over 20 hours de-weeding large stretches of the road by hand, and we have just spent more than this again and barely made a dent on the Vesta Road and Drakefell Road ends. The weeds are a tripping hazard for people unsteady on their feet, but they are also unsightly and perhaps that untidiness, and apparent lack of care for our surroundings, contributes to passersby feeling they can litter and fly tip along the length of the road. Finally, soil seems to accumulate where the road surface meets the curbside, and that again provides much food for new crops of weeds to sprout. We could dearly benefit from the council both weeding the pavements and cleaning the road.",
