If you sent someone there you would know that for yourself instead of expecting the public to spoon feed you the information.\n\nThere's also a set of metal gates that goes to Phoenix community councils new building site opposite all the guys vans, this has rubbish dumped there also.\n\nYou totally ignored the fact that there's oil all over the pavement, car parts scattered everywhere and other automotive fluids due to this persons actions. Would you like to live next door to scrapman so all his rubbish can be outside your house?",

Cars are parked outside the new Co-op so cars heading towards the 205 from Stanstead Road are already overtaking parked cars at that point and meet any vehicle emerging from Rockbourn Road.
