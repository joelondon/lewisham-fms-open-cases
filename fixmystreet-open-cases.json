Every week or so our recycling bins are overflowing and residents are forced to place a significant amount of recyclables in the normal waste bins. This has been documented for at least 10 months and the problems still continue but Lewisham Council has wrongly stated that the block has adequate capacity. Our recycling bins have been full for over a week so we continue to waste recyclables. Photo attached.",
