I followed the trail of tarmac up Priestfield Road this morning where the men had \"repaired\" so called trip hazards. Very nice to get them done but just wish the men would use a broom to sweep away the excess tarmac rather than leave it to get stuck on shoes, buggy wheels and worst still in dogs paws. I am sure the council would not want the vet bills for the problems these sticky bits of tarmac cause. Lessons in use of broom required please!!",

So many cars come up this small Close an turn round. We have quite a few small children living in this Close now and it is very dangerous for the amount of cars that come up here an turn round, many because they think they can get out the other end. I have lived in this Close for many years and I have always wondered why we do not have a sign up. Can you please forward this request on to the right department for me if you cannot deal with it . Thankyou"
