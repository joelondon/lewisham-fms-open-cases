I have reported this to Pinnacle, Regenter and Lewisham Council and none have taken any action to resolve this, they just put the finger at the other.\n\nTwo of our recycling bins are full again. One (the cardboard bin) has been full for a week, the other (bottle) for a few days. The third bin with bottle slots may only be partially used so residents have no choice but to put cardboard and other items in the normal waste bins.\n\nBecause of Lewisham Council and Pinnacle's ongoing neglect approx 25-30% of our recyclables have been placed in the wrong bins for over a year. Neither care about this and apparently no-one is accountable.\n\nIt is beyond incompetence and just a waste of tax payers money - Lewisham Council;",
