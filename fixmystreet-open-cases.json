This causes our walls, floors, and every part of the house to jump. Neighbours complain of pictures shaking on walls, cracks appearing in front garden walls and interior plaster. We’ve many of such cracks but haven’t been here long enough to say what has caused them. But I can assure you that the entire house jumps. The house is 150 years old, probably with shallow foundations on clay soil, but every single neighbour the whole length of the road (and round the corner onto Vesta Road) has reported the same thuds and thumps. Our houses are being damaged, our right to quiet enjoyment of our homes is being disrupted and our mental health is suffering. Many of us have written to TFL (they say it’s not their fault but have asked their drivers to slow down - a few have most haven’t), we have written to the council (apparently they think vibrations can’t damage properties!) so far with absolutely no result. A previous complaint on Fix My Street was closed by the council who mistakenly filed it as a speeding complaint. The issue is with the enormous speed tables and the fact that the buses are routed down our road. The buses don’t need to be speeding, merely driving under the 20mph speed limit causes every house to shake. Perhaps if the speed limit was 10mph we wouldn’t be suffering this issue, but fundamentally the speed tables have to go. We have considered a vibration survey to underline how damaging the vibrations are, but it shouldn’t fall to the residents to pay for this. Please could someone from the council respond to this in a meaningful way. Yours Reinhart Nell, for an on behalf of every resident on Sprules Road.",

These are particularly difficult to walk on for those in 'equality' categories eg the elderly, infirm and carers with prams. Further more, because the stones are in very close proximity to Calmont Road (and generally are all over it), this is dangerous for cyclists and in addition, car wheels can flick the stones into the air dangerously.",
