    "description": "Dangerous fence at Nesbit Close: There is a very dangerous wobbly fence on top of a large hill. The fence moves and is very close to homes below the hill. Non residents use the space in the fence as a short cut which damages the fence more making the gap bigger and wobbly. I originally reported this incident on 7th February 2022 to James however nothing has been done unfortunately and the fence continues to get weaker. The fence is now leaning back and is only a matter of time before it falls completely. Please can you advise. Many thanks"
