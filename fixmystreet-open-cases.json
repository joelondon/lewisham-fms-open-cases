Some of the driver go a little slower and the jolt is less noticeable but many hit the bumps without slowing and our houses jump as they do. Many neighbours have noticed new cracks and damage since the electric buses arrived in March 2021. We are all worrying about damage to the fascias, walls, and possibly even subsidence if the problem isn’t solved. The council is passing the buck to TfL. TfL apparently don’t accept that buses can damage houses 🙄 The bus company have apparently however asked drivers to drive slower, but as stated many of them hit the bumps at speed. A solution might be to cut grooves in the speed bumps to accommodate the buses’ wheels, or to re-route the bus route (though that could inconvenience the school), but something more than driver education needs to be done.",

West of the bridge Lewisham is the highway authority, and north of the bridge Greenwich is the highway authority.\n\nShown in the picture is the shiny new 10T weight restriction sign installed at Bromley taxpayers' expense to the east of the bridge. There are no weight restriction signs to the north of the bridge (Greenwich) or to the west of the bridge (Lewisham).\n\nLewisham assert that the bridge now has a 40T weight limit (presumably believing it has been strengthened) and they gleaned this information from Bromley.\n\nEither Bromley has squandered taxpayers' money on the new sign or Lewisham has made a mistake in removing the 10T limit signs.\n\nTo further confuse matters, there is a second bridge over the River Quaggy this time on Mottingham Lane, again on the boundary of Bromley and Greenwich, but with Greenwich the highway authority. Could it be that this bridge has the 10T limit.\n\nWhatever the answer, this matter needs investigating as a matter of urgency, and the investigation should include liaising with Lewisham and Greenwich highway authorities to get to the bottom of this matter and ensuring that all three highway authorities display the correct signage for the bridge.",
