They are located in the road near to the dropped kerb outside number 34 Senlac Road. The cover nearest to the centre of the road makes a noise when vehicles drive over it, this noise disturbs our sleep, we have tried to live with it but cannot no longer. Please get it fixed so we can get some sleep. Please do not mark this problem as fixed when nothing has been done about it.",

This mess is now down the wall below and over the windows of the two flats below.\n\nLewisham Homes do not manage the whole of Stephens Court. However, they do rent flat 5 from the owner to provide social housing. Please can you check this as my other report was rejected.\n\nPlease can you arrange for someone from Lewisham Homes to attend and clean this up. Thank you."
