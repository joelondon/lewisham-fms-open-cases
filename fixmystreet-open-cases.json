I've already reported fly-tipping at the front and here I'm reporting (1) an untidy terrace straight outside our bedroom window; and (2) an abandoned garden with blackberry aggressively spreading and overspilling into other properties/gardens. Again, apologies if this is not the right place to report such an issue. I do hope there's a chance that Lewisham council could encourage the owners to tidy up those areas. Thank you",

    "description": "Eyesore untidy property: Hi there, apologies in advance if this type of report does not qualify for this channel. I'm not even sure if Lewisham deals with these types of issues (I've read that some councils do). Property 124, has a few untidy areas that need sorting. I've already reported fly-tipping at the front and here I'm reporting (1) an untidy terrace straight outside our bedroom window; and (2) an abandoned garden with blackberry aggressively spreading and overspilling into other properties/gardens. Again, apologies if this is not the right place to report such an issue. I do hope there's a chance that Lewisham council could encourage the owners to tidy up those areas. Thank you",
